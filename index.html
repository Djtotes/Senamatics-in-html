        You have been born into an era of intelligent machines. They have watched over you almost since your conception.
        They let your parents listen in on your tiny heartbeat, track your gestation on an app, and post your sonogram
        on social media. Well before you were born, you were known to the algorithm.

        Your arrival coincided with the 125th anniversary of this magazine. With a bit of luck and the right genes, you
        might see the next 125 years. How will you and the next generation of machines grow up together?, We asked more
        than a dozen experts to imagine your joint future. We explained that this would be a thought experiment. What I
        mean is: We asked them to get weird.

      <h3>Global Market</h3>
      <article>
        Since 2020, the world has seen two crises that have had a massive impact on the global economy. First, as the
        coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading that year, companies and stores around the world were forced to shut
        down, resulting in a global economic downturn. Then, as the economy was slowly starting to recover from the
        effects of COVID-19, Russia's President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine in February 2022, which
        resulted in rising inflation. At first there were fears of a global recession, but as of January 2024, it seems
        that most countries have fared better than first feared, and consumer confidence has bee increasing since
        November 2022. However, Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 and the resulting war in Gaza has further
        spurred global uncertainties, and attacks by the Houthi militia based in Yemen on ships travelling through the
        Red Sea has disrupted international trade routes.

        Global economy can be defined as the sum of activities that take place both within a country and between
        different countries. Each country is a separate unit, with its own industrial production, labor market,
        financial market, resources and environment. The globalization enabled and enhanced the development of
        international trade, finance, and migration of labor, where countries need to find common solutions and
        cooperate with one another. One of the effects of the globalization is that drastic changes in one country
        influence other countries. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have effected the whole
        global economy.
